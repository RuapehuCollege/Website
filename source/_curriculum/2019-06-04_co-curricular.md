# Production

Ruapehu College offers all students the opportunity to audition for the annual school production. This is an activity that requires dedication and commitment beyond the classroom in order to produce quality shows. The last two years have seen some very high caliber performances given in locally penned plays based on events in the Ohakune area. "Mountain Uplift" (2016) and "Mollie" (2018) were both very well received by audiences.



# Duke of Edinburgh Hillary award

# Smokefree Rockquest

Students have the opportunity to compete in the Smokefree Rockquest as a solo act or member of a duo or band. Ruapehu College debuted at this event in 2017 with Year 13 student Xavia Steedman-Wills winning 2nd place in the Solo/Duo category. Year 10 students Kate Rowe, Ryan Burton and Nazomi Groot ("etc, etc...") took out the Lowdown Award for Best Song. They recently competed in the 2018 event, winning the ZM People's Choice Award and securing a chance to reach the National Final.



# Performance concerts

We aim to hold one major concert event per Term to give the students opportunities to perform in legitimate live contexts. Previous events have included "Pumanawa" (a showcase of new talent during New Zealand Music Month), NCEA Assessment Concerts and various Prizegivings.
