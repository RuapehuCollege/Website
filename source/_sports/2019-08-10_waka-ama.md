Waka Ama is a sport that has become increasingly popular with our students and the College has competed in the secondary schools national competition in Rotorua for the last two years running. 

Waka Ama is  a sport which requires a high level of skill,strength and stamina but also offers our students a great opportunity to interact with Maori culture and learn relevant tikanga. 

Students carry out their on water training after schools and at weekends on the Whanganui river and paddle out of Putiki.
