Ruapehu College has a strong presence in the local Rugby community and has three teams competing in the regional Whanganui Rugby competition, at the Under 15, Under 19 and Girls grades. Students have the oppertunity to take part in a pre season training camp where they can work on skills, stratergy and fitness with our coaches who include local representative players and former All Blacks. As well as the 15-a-side code the school also fields teams in the game of Sevens towards the end of the season.
