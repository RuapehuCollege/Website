With Ohakune Squash Club located next door to the college it is no suprise that a number of students are involved in the sport.  

Students are exposed to squash through the junior school physical education and health programme and some choose to pursue the sport further utelizing the onsite facitities in breaks and lunches. 

The school usually fields a team in the New Zealand Secondary School Championships and has had some great success in the past.
